## Test 03: clear [1 pts]

Ensures clear() works correctly by checking the list size and accessibility of cleared elements (requires size() to be implemented)

### Subtest 01: clear
```
elist.c:43:elist_create(): Initializing new elist: capacity = [100], item_sz=[4], bytes[400]

> Assertion: list != NULL [  OK  ]

> Assertion: size == 100 [  OK  ]

> Assertion: size == 0 [  OK  ]

> Assertion: size == 1 [  OK  ]

> Assertion: result == NULL [  OK  ]

> Assertion: result == NULL [  OK  ]

> Assertion: result != NULL [  OK  ]

--> Subtest passed
```

### Subtest 02: clear_mem
```
elist.c:43:elist_create(): Initializing new elist: capacity = [1000], item_sz=[4], bytes[4000]

> Assertion: list != NULL [  OK  ]

> Assertion: size == 1000 [  OK  ]

> Assertion: size == 0 [  OK  ]

> Assertion: size == 1 [  OK  ]

> Assertion: result == NULL [  OK  ]

> Assertion: result == NULL [  OK  ]

> Assertion: result != NULL [  OK  ]

> Assertion: total == 1001 [  OK  ]
> total: 1001

--> Subtest passed
```
